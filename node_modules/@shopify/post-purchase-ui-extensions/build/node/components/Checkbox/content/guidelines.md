## Best practices

- Be framed positively: for example, Turn on notifications instead of Turn off notifications.
- Be aware of any legal issues around checkboxes - for example, to comply with GDPR, marketing sign-up checkboxes should always be deselected by default.
- Link to more information or include a subtitle as required to provide more explanation. Donâ€™t rely on tooltips to explain a checkbox.
